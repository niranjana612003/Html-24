  <h1 id="para1">TAJ MAHAL</h1>
    <p id="para1">
     The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape, reddish pathway, and blue sky over it showcases the monument in ever-changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi-precious stones make it a monument apart.The Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in Agra, India between 1631 and 1648 to honor his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, after her death. The name Taj Mahal is believed to come from the Persian words taj, meaning crown, and mahal, meaning palace.The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum known for its architectural splendor. It was built by some of the world's finest artisans.Acid rain is a major threat to the Taj Mahal. When acid rain falls on the marble, it reacts to form a powder that is then washed away by the rain. This process is known as marble cancer.
