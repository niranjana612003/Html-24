	India Gate is one of many British monuments built by order of the Imperial War Graves Commission (later renamed Commonwealth War Graves Commission).
	The architect was Sir Edwin Lutyens, an Englishman who designed numerous other war memorials and was also the principal planner of New Delhi. 
	The cornerstone was laid in 1921 by the duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria. Construction of the All-India War Memorial, as it was originally known,
	continued until 1931, the year of the formal dedication of New Delhi as the capital of India.Lutyens declined to incorporate pointed arches or other
	Asian motifs in his design but strove instead for classical simplicity. The result is often described as similar in appearance to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
	On the rooftop above the archway is a broad shallow domed bowl that was intended to be filled with flaming oil on ceremonial occasions.
	No fires have been set on the rooftop in recent years, but four eternal flames are now sheltered at the base of the structure.
	The flames demarcate the Amar Jawan Jyoti, a small monument that has served as Indiaâ€™s tomb of the unknown soldier since 1971.
