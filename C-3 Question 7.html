    <p id="para1">Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is a time of joy, family gatherings, and vibrant celebrations. As homes are illuminated with colourful diyas and the night sky sparkles with fireworks, another essential<br> element adds to the festive spirit: sweets. In India, sweets hold a special place in our hearts and our traditions, especially during Diwali. They symbolize love, prosperity, and the joy of sharing. Each<br> sweet has its own significance, and together they create a rich tapestry of flavors and emotions that enhance the festive spirit. In the context of Diwali, sweets are often associated with the worship of<br>Lord Rama. The festival commemorates his return to Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. People celebrate this victory of good over evil by sharing sweets, as a way to express their<br> happiness and gratitude. It is a divine offering, symbolizing the abundance of blessings that have come into their lives.</p>
